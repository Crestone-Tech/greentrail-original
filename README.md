# GreenTrail

## Description

Small towns have a lot to love. If small towns are going to thrive on their own terms, they need a way to promote themselves. Local festivals need to be on a visible calendar. Family-owned hotels and street taco stands need to be marketed to travelers. Every fisherman who is ready to take tourists to see the beauty of their coast needs a way that visitors can find them. Community providers need a way to connect with passionate travelers, who seek the authenticity of the community they are visiting.

Enter GreenTrail! A web application designed to help users explore communities and for locals to manage local services, providers, and locations. The more people add their businesses and local favorites to a community page, the more interesting the community becomes to travelers. The application is built with Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, Passport, Google OAuth 2.0, and Handlebars.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The website can be visited at https://greentrail.onrender.com/.

From the Home page, users can choose to navigate to a "Locations" page or a "Login" page.

On the Login page, users can sign up, sign in using an existing account, or sign in using Google OAuth 2.0. Once a user has successfully logged in, they will see an option to "Logout" and an additional option on the website to "Add" services to a community. When the logout is clicked, the user will go back to seeing the normal options.

On the Locations page, users can view a featured location or navigate to another community by clicking the drop-down arrow next to a country and navigating to a town name.

When a user clicks on the feature location's "See more" button or clicks on a town name, they will be taken to that town's "Community" page. On this page, the user can see an image of the location, as well as a host of information about the town, including places to stay, eat, and adventure!

When a logged-in user clicks on the "Add" page, they will be given options to add places to stay, eat, something to do, and services to provide.
